<p>The first volume is meant for those getting started in the gig economy, or contemplating diving in. It should also be useful to those who've been trying to find their footing for a while, but struggling. The second volume is for those who have found their footing and looking to refine and develop their approach further.</p>

<h2>Yakverse Project</h2>

<p>The newsletter also featured absurdist speculative-fiction stories about the indie consulting life set in a world called the Yakverse. These stories are now the core of an online collaborative fiction project called the Yakverse. You can read the original stories, explore the Yakverse, and contribute new stories, at this Roam site.</p>
